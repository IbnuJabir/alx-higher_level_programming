# Python Almost a Circle

## Overview

This project is part of the Alx Higher Level Programming curriculum, specifically focusing on Python programming. The project involves implementing classes and inheritance to create a framework for managing rectangles and squares, culminating in the creation of a nearly complete implementation of a Circle class. The goal is to solidify understanding of object-oriented programming principles in Python.

## Project Structure

The project directory structure is organized as follows:

- `models/`: Contains the Python scripts implementing the Rectangle, Square, and Circle classes.
- `tests/`: Includes unit tests for the classes implemented in the `models` directory.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IbnuJabir/0x0C-python-almost_a_circle.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x0C-python-almost_a_circle
    ```

3. Explore the `models` directory to view the implementation of the Rectangle, Square, and Circle classes.

4. Run the unit tests to verify the functionality of the classes:

    ```bash
    python3 -m unittest discover tests
    ```

5. Begin experimenting with the classes and their methods to understand how they work and how they can be extended or modified for different use cases.
